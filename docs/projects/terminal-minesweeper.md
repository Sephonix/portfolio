# Terminal Minesweeper
## Introduction
This was my attempt at recreating Minesweeper in the Windows Terminal in C++. The project was an optional challenge given by my introductory ***Computer Programming for Engineering Problem Solving** - ENG 150* class at Old Dominion University. 

The game's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sephonix/terminal-minesweeper).

## Game
The project was made and build with [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
