# Concealed Crossings
## Introduction
This project was created in 2020 for my OLHS Math & Science Academy Senior Design Project. The game was built in [Unity](https://unity.com/) using C#, using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for 3D modeling and [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com) for character animations.

The game's source code is available [GitHub](https://github.com/Sephonix/concealed-crossings).
## Game
Concealed Crossings is a small 3rd person demo game that went through many iterations for its design. Currently, there is no gameplay loop, only an environment for the player to explore. In the future, I plan to revisit this project and turn it into an actual game.
